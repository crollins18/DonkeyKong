## Instructions
Your job is to make it to the top of the level and save Princess Peach!
Use the `W`, `A`, `S`, or `D` keys for movement and the `SPACEBAR` to jump.
Pressing `H` in the game will bring up a help dialog box with this information.
You will be timed for level completion and the timer starts once you enter your name in the starting dialog box.
Your goal is to finish the level as fast as possible with the lowest score.
